# ESP_Mesh
The usage of ESP8266 is popular in IoT environment, Due to its cheap and reliable microcontroller with advantages of IEEE 802.11 make it suitable for wireless connection mainly for transfering data.This software is an implementation of mesh network on top of IEEE 802.11

What the software do
--------------------
This software is providing a mesh network topologies for Wi-Fi (IEEE 802.11) of ESSP8266 based Microcontroller. The microcontroller will be config with own SSID and password where it will form the mesh network through RSSI levelling of all the microcontroller

*This project is only for proof-of-concept

Build
-----------
This software was created using [ESP Open SDK](https://github.com/xxxajk/esp-open-sdk).
